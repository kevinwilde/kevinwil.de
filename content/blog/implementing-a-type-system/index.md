In December 2020, I presented a workshop at Reactathon in which we implemented a two static type systems -- the first relied on type annotations by the programmer (i.e. `x:int` or `y:string`), and the second was capable of full type inference.

The GitHub repository for the workshop is located at https://github.com/kevinwilde/type-system-workshop.
